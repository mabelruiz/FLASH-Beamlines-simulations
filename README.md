## FLASH-Beamlines-simulations

#The simulations of the focusing FLASH Beamlines (in FLASH1 and FLASH2) are written to be read in Jupyter notebook. 
#To run them simulations, an installation of Anaconda and WPG (https://wpg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wpg.html) is needed. 


The following examples can be found in the repository:
- Simulation of the beamline FL24
- Simulation of the beamline BL3
- Simulation of the (non-exisiting anymore) beamline BL2
