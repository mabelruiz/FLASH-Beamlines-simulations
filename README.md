# FLASH-Beamlines-simulations

### The simulations of the focusing FLASH Beamlines (in FLASH1 and FLASH2) are Jupyter notebook files. 
### To run them simulations, an installation of Anaconda and WPG (https://wpg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wpg.html) is needed. 


The following examples can be found in the repository under the folder "Beamlines":
- Simulation of the beamline FL24 (Ell_KAOS)
- Simulation of the beamline BL3 
- Simulation of the (non-exisiting anymore) beamline BL2

To run these files in WPG, they have to be included in the folder "Tutorials".
The other folders also need to be included into the folder "Tutorials" in WPG.
